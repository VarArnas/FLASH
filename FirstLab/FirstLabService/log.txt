Evaluate the correctness based on content, ensuring all criteria specified in the question are met (the criteria will start after the word "required" after the question itself). Score '1' if the student's answer fully meets all criteria. Score '0.5' if it's partially correct or lacks some required information. Score '0' if incorrect. Note: Consider synonyms or equivalent terms as correct, but only if they meet the question's criteria. Provide your response as a single number: '1', '0.5', or '0', and with no additional text or symbols.
